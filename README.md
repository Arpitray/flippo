# 🧠 Flippo

**A visual memory game — match the images.

## 🧩 What is Flippo?

**Flippo** is a memory-based puzzle game where your goal is to **match identical image pairs** on a grid. Each level increases in difficulty with more tiles and images. It’s a fun way to test your focus, memory, and speed.

---

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Click a tile to reveal the image hidden behind it  
2. Click a second tile — if it matches the first, the pair stays flipped  
3. If not, both tiles flip back after a short delay  
4. Match all the pairs to win the round!  
5. The game tracks your number of moves — fewer is better!

## 📊 Difficulty Levels

| Level   | Grid Size | Total Tiles | Pairs to Match |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Easy    | 4 × 2     | 8           | 4              |
| Medium  | 4 × 3     | 12          | 6              |
| Hard    | 6 × 4     | 24          | 12             |

Each level shuffles image positions to ensure a unique game every time.
